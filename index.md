I am Bharath Raghavan, a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, one of the foremost supercomputing centers in the world, and my research mission is to accelerate the application of high performance computing to automate drug design and discovery. Highly scalable quantum simulations, coupled with complex deep learning neural networks, can give us intricate atomic-level insights of pharmaceutically relevant enzyme function. I believe that this deep quantum-level understanding of our biology can greatly streamline the drug design process by promoting the rational and scientific design of inhibitors. The wider promulgation of supercomputing technologies will allow the scientific community to unlock the huge potential of AI-accelerated quantum simulations for pharmacology. Contact me if you wish to collaborate on these exciting ideas!
