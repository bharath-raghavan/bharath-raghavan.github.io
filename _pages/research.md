<div style="text-align: justify">
I am involved in the <a href="https://mimic-project.org/en/latest/">MiMiC project</a> together with <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/carloni_p">Prof. Dr. Paolo Carloni</a>, <a href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/jógvan-magnus-haugaard-olsen">Dr. Jógvan Magnus Haugaard Olsen</a> and <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcbc/roethlisberger/">Prof. Ursula Röthilsberger</a>. The MiMiC framework is an open-source, general platform that enables the implementation of multiscale computational (bio)chemistry simulation methods through coupling of multiple external programs, designed for massively parallel applications with a multiple-programs multiple-data model. The program is written in a combination of Fortran and C++, and parallelizaed with a hybrid MPI/OpenMP approach. Currently, MiMiC couples the CPMD and GROMACS codes to perform highly scalable QM/MM biomolecular simulations on HPC systems.

I am the lead developer of <a href="https://mimic-project.org/en/latest/mimicpy/overview.html">MiMiCPy</a>, an open-source Python toolkit as a companion to MiMiC. The code greatly simplifies the preparation and debugging of MiMiC-based QM/MM input files via a user-friendly interface. It provides an extensive list of command-line tools with an easy-to-use selection language to pick out the QM region. Plugins for PyMOL and VMD alow the selection of complex QM regions visually. MiMiCPy can also be used as a Python library, allowing one to develop complex workflows to set up MiMiC-based QM/MM simulations. The package has been designed with a modular and object-oriented approach. This allows one (i) to easily support new topology and coordinate file formats from different programs, when they become available in MiMiC; (ii) to develop new tools as MiMiC expands its functionalities.

<br>
I was involved in early efforts to couple MiMiC-QM/MM simulations with machine learning-based force fields. This was carried out as part of the Helmholtz GPU Hackathon 2020 in collaboration with Andrea Rizzi, Florian Schakerth and Viacheslav Bolynkh. I designed a MiMiC data reader for the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00994">PiNN library</a>, and contributed to parallelization efforts of the tensorflow-based atomic neural network on multiple GPUs. I also contribute to testing, documentation and communication activities related to MiMiC. I spearheaded training activities at the <a href="https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/1119">CECAM Flagship School on MiMiC</a> held at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) on 18 to 22 July 2022 and the <a href="https://flagship.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/jss/HBPm?m=showAgenda&meetingID=242">Simulate with EBRAINS</a> event held by the Human Brian Project on 10th Nov 2022.
