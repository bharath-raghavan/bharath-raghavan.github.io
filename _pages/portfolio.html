I am involved in the MiMiC project together with a network of various Eurpoean researchers. It involves the developement of a new open source software for performing QM/MM molecular simulations using efficient MPI/OpenMP communication scheme.

My contributions:

- Testing of the crucial communication library and the software's scaling with the largest protein system simulated so far.
- Main developer for the MiMiCPy python interface of MiMiC. Allows for advanced 'pythonic' access of MiMiC input preparation/run functionalities. Comes with command line tools, and integration with molecular visualization packages for efficient building of MiMiC runs.

Skills demonstrated:
- Languages: C++, Python
- Colllabrative development: Git version control, GitHub, GitLab
- Development enviornments: GCC, Intel, OpenMPI, CMake/Make, GDB
- Test driven development: Pytest, GoogleTest, GitLab CI
- HPC cloud environment: MPI, Bash Shell, SSH, Paramiko

My Doctral thesis is conducted within the Helmholtz European Partnering Project between Forschungszentrum Juelich and Italian Institute of Technology. The main goal is computational drug design against neuroloigcal diseases and glioma by targeting the protein Isocitrate Dehydrogenase.
